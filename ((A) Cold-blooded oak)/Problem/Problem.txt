There is a tree with n vertices and n-1 edges, and the root vertex has number 1. (3 ≤ n ≤ 200000)

You have to perform the following m queries: (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000)
add x y: Hangs y light bulbs on node x.
del x y: Removes y light bulbs from node x.
ask x: Asks to count f(x).
(2 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ 10000)

f(x)=∑g(v) (Here, v∈ST(x))
ST (x) is a set of vertices such that if you hang a light bulb in them, then the wire that it will have to be drawn to will pass through the edge(x, p(x)).
g(v) is the number of wires currently passing through the edge (v, p(v))
