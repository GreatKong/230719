First, you have to store the entrance and exit times on each node from the root and the depth of each node, respectively.
When asked to sum over a set of nodes, you have to calculate the range of nodes it needs to sum over using the previously stored entrance and exit times. It then queries the relevant range in the Fenwick tree to get the answer.
In addition to deletion operations, the Fenwick tree at the correct indices is updated using the aforementioned depth and parent-child relationship.
